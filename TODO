- Do we have to free all memory on croak() to avoid a leak?  Can we
  use scopes for that?

- skip_reply() function, counter for pending replies to skip.  On
  every call skip what's pending until request is pushed (and reply is
  got).

- Move the tree into separate repository.

- server::request_buf may have the type of struct command_state *.

- Improve make files: libclient.a should not be installed (does it
  now?).
