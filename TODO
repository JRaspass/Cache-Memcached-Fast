- Do we have to free all memory on croak() to avoid a leak?  Can we
  use scopes for that?

  got).

- Move the tree into separate repository.

- Improve make files: libclient.a should not be installed (does it
  now?).

- Add doc section "Compatibility with Cache::Memcached".



my $have_compress_zlib;

BEGIN {
    $have_compress_zlib = eval { use Compress::Zlib; 1; };
}


- In the distant future, it would be interesting to compare
  one-pass-restartable approach to classical accumulate-in-buffer one.
