- Do we have to free all memory on croak() to avoid a leak?  Can we
  use scopes for that?

- skip_reply() function, counter for pending replies to skip.  On
  every call skip what's pending until request is pushed (and reply is
  got).

- Improve make files: libclient.a should not be installed (does it
  now?).

- Add doc section "Compatibility with Cache::Memcached".


Use IO::Compress::Gzip.

my $have_compress_zlib;

BEGIN {
    $have_compress_zlib = eval { use Compress::Zlib; 1; };
}


- Use better rounding in flush_all().

- Disable noreply in benchmark.pl, remove append/prepend before shipping.

- Set $! on errors.
