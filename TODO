- Improve make files: libclient.a should not be installed (does it
  now?).

- Mention server patches in docs.

- Binary protocol!

- stats() command.

- UDP (?).

- Investigate why there are read() errors in no_eagain branch.

- In find_bucket() replace binary search with interpolation search.

- Add test for noreply, do not list it in MANIFEST.

- tainted_in, tainted_out parameters.

- 'more' flag for better streaming latency.

- Instead of accumulating requests do I/O on every client_prepare_*()
  to improve streaming speed.

- Add statistics: count item sizes, requests, timeouts/errors.

- Replace av_push() with av_store(), test result.

- Describe how to report a bug (-vv, -g).

- Can we do anything with artifacts in benchmark.pl?

- Investigate why we are still not fast enough on short values.

- Fix

    client.c: In function `store_result':
    client.c:823: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size

  warnings.  They are safe, but annoying.  Use longs instead of ints.

- Add benchmark for compression.
