- Do we have to free all memory on croak() to avoid a leak?  Can we
  use scopes for that?

- Improve make files: libclient.a should not be installed (does it
  now?).

- Move "require $compress_module" close to the place where name is set.

- Set $! on errors.

- Better result value: distinct between negative outcome (false) and
  failure (undef).  flush_all() should return true only on success
  with all servers.

- Make 'noreply' parameter per-server.

- Mention server patches in docs.

- Binary protocol!

- stats() command.

- UDP (?).


For 0.05:

- nowait (per server flag): skip_reply() function, counter for pending
  replies to skip.  On every call skip what's pending until request is
  pushed (and reply is got).

- Document how to inherit from C::M::F for Custom Serialization for
  instance.
