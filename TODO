- Do we have to free all memory on croak() to avoid a leak?  Can we
  use scopes for that?

- skip_reply() function, counter for pending replies to skip.  On
  every call skip what's pending until request is pushed (and reply is
  got).

- Improve make files: libclient.a should not be installed (does it
  now?).

- Move "require $compress_module" close to the place where name is set.

- Use better rounding in flush_all().

- Set $! on errors.

- Add libketama.

- Better result value: distinct between negative outcome (false) and
  failure (undef).  flush_all() should return true only on success
  with all servers.
