Cache-Memcached-Fast version 0.19
=================================

Cache::Memcahced::Fast is a Perl client for memcached, a memory cache
daemon (http://www.danga.com/memcached/).  Module core is implemented
in C and tries hard to minimize number of system calls and to avoid
any key/value copying for speed.  As a result, it has very low CPU
consumption.

API is largely compatible with Cache::Memcached, original pure Perl
client, most users of the original module may start using this module
by installing it and adding "::Fast" to the old name in their scripts
(see "Compatibility with Cache::Memcached" section in the module
documentation for full details).

The module does not depend on any external library, it contains custom
memcached client implementation in C designed for efficient
interaction with Perl (actually client code has well defined generic
API and may be used by itself).

The module should compile and work on any Unix-derived system.  Win32
support is based on the patch by Yasuhiro Matsumoto---thanks!, and is
(expected to be) supported by community.  Note: on Win32 below Windows
Vista max number of memcached servers is 64.  See comment on
FD_SETSIZE in src/socket_win32.h to learn how to increase this value
if you need to connect to more than 64 servers.

Despite the low version number (which mainly reflects release history)
the module is considered to be beta (see BUGS below on how to report
bugs).  See "Compatibility with Cache::Memcached" section in the
module documentation for the description of what is missing compared
to Cache::Memcached.
